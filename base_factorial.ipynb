    "A 5 kyu problem from https://www.codewars.com/kata/54e320dcebe1e583250008fd\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding decimal numbers with factorials is a way of writing out numbers in a base system that depends on factorials, rather than powers of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, the last digit is always 0 and is in base 0!. The digit before that is either 0 or 1 and is in base 1!. The digit before that is either 0, 1, or 2 and is in base 2!, etc. More generally, the nth-to-last digit is always 0, 1, 2, ..., n and is in base n!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about it at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The decimal number 463 is encoded as \"341010\", because:\n",
    "\n",
    "463 = 3×5! + 4×4! + 1×3! + 0×2! + 1×1! + 0×0!\n",
    "= ((((3×5 + 4)×4 + 1)×3 + 0)×2 + 1)×1 + 0\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are limited to digits 0..9, the biggest number we can encode is 10!-1 (= 3628799). So we extend 0..9 with letters A..Z. With these 36 digits we can now encode numbers up to 36!-1 (= 3.72 × 1041)\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need two functions. The first one will receive a decimal number and return a string with the factorial representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one will receive a string with a factorial representation and produce the decimal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given numbers will always be positive.\n"
